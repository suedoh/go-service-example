Apologies in advance for basic instructions on the first push.

To build the project, make sure you have docker installed.

This project is using a Makefile to run commands, so please make sure you have make installed before running the project.

To run the project in develpment mode, run the command `make run`. Development focused only right now so again, apologies for being brief.
